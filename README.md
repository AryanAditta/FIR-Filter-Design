# FIR Filter Design - DSP Open-ended Project

### Implementation and Analysis of FIR Filters using Windowing Techniques

This project explores the design and characteristics of **Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filters** using different window functions. The filters implemented include **Low-Pass, High-Pass, Band-Pass, and Band-Stop FIR filters**, and their performance is analyzed through frequency and magnitude response evaluation.

## Features
✔️ **Custom FIR filter design using MATLAB**  
✔️ **Windowing techniques: Rectangular, Hamming, Hann, Blackman**  
✔️ **Frequency response analysis: Magnitude, Impulse, and Pole-Zero plots**  
✔️ **Audio signal filtering for noise reduction**  

## Design & Methodology
- **Filter Types Implemented:**  
  - Low-Pass Filter (LPF)  
  - High-Pass Filter (HPF)  
  - Band-Pass Filter (BPF)  
  - Band-Stop Filter (BSF)  
- **Windowing Methods:** Rectangular, Hann, Hamming, Blackman  
- **Implementation:** FIR filter coefficients calculated and applied in MATLAB  
- **Analysis Metrics:** Frequency response, magnitude response, and impulse response
